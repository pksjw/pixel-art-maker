## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Changes
Code has been added to designs.js and adjustments made to index.html to create a grid of squares that can be set to different colors allowing for the creation of patterns and pictures using a single or multiple colors.
